## Introduction

The remarkable predictive success of science is the primary motivation for scientific realism.
Realists claim that this success is too impressive to be accidental, and the best and the only non-
miraculous explanation for it is that mature scientific theories are approximately true (Putnam,
1975, p. 73). This is known as the “No Miracles Argument” (NMA). The NMA can be
formulated as follows:

- Mature scientific theories are remarkably successful in prediction and explanation.
- This success requires a non-coincidental explanation.
- Such best explanation for their success is the approximate truth of these theories.
- Therefore, successful theories are approximately true.

Yet this appealing intuition is philosophically unstable. In this essay, I argue that the NMA fails
as a justification for scientific realism for three central reasons. First, it begs the question by
presupposing the truth-tracking reliability of Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) in the very
domain it is meant to justify. Second, the NMA’s rarely acknowledged dependence on a
uniqueness-of-truth assumption, which states that there exists a single, uniquely correct
description of the unobservable world toward which science converges, puts it at odds with
scientific practice. Third, Constructive Empiricism (CE) provides a coherent alternative that
avoids these problems while proving false the NMA’s bold claim that realism is the only option. I
then briefly examine a major realist strategy, Structural Realism (SR), and argue that it fails to
rescue the NMA. Taken together, these arguments demonstrate that the NMA lacks a stable
philosophical foundation to justify scientific realism.

## Circular Reasoning in the Unobservable Domain

NMA depends on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE), the idea that justifies the best
explanation of a phenomenon is true (Lipton, 1991, p.11). Realists use IBE to infer that the
success of a theory is best explained by its approximate truth. However, IBE is domain-
dependent, and that justification begs the question when applied to unobservable entities. The
reliability of IBE in this domain cannot be confirmed without already assuming that the “best”
explanation of scientific success – the realist’s explanation – is true. In the observable domain,
abductive inferences can be tested and corrected: if it’s inferred that a strange noise is best
explained by a broken pipe, one can check. But no such independent confirmation mechanism
exists in the unobservable domain (van Fraassen, 1980, p. 21) – take caloric fluid (French, 2016,
p. 136) or ether (French, 2016, p. 17) for example. In simple terms, the IBE’s reliability is used
to justify realism, while realism’s claim is used to justify IBE. Realists attempt to compare this to
the benign circularity present in using deductive reasoning to justify deduction. When inspected
in depth, however, this analogy does not hold true. While deductive rules, by definition, preserve
truth, IBE is abductive in the sense that it introduces new content and thus risks of fallacy. As
van Fraassen (1989) puts it: the “best” explanation may be the “best of a bad lot” (p. 21) – good
only relative to the available alternatives, not necessarily true. IBE has no independent check that
validates its own reliability in the unobservable domain. This makes IBE circularity vicious –
risking a fallible inference in precisely the domain where it cannot be tested. Thus, NMA relies
on an unjustifiable reasoning pattern at its heart – rendering it unreliable for the justification of
realism.

## The Uniqueness-of-Truth Assumption against Scientific Practice

Even more profound problems with the NMA concern an implicit metaphysical premise. For
NMA to work as intended, these assumptions must be granted:

1.  There exists a single, uniquely correct description of the (unobservable) world.
2.  Scientific theories could approximate this unique truth.
3.  IBE is a method capable of converging on that truth.

The first premise is rarely stated explicitly, likely because it’s often taken for granted. Yet it’s
neither trivial nor supported by scientific practice. If multiple incompatible yet successful models
can coexist, then success no longer indicates convergence toward a single truth. Contemporary
scientific practice often suggests _model pluralism_ – fields such as quantum physics, climate
science, and biology employ _multiple_, sometimes _incompatible_ models that each succeed within
their own domains, often sharing tradeoffs between accuracy, simplicity, and explanatory clarity.
Utilization of several models to explain different behaviors of the atomic nucleus is undeniable
evidence for this (Frigg & Hartmann, 2006). Nuclear physicists use the _liquid-drop model_,
treating the nucleus as a charged, continuous fluid, to predict phenomena like nuclear fission.
Another subset of scientists employs the _shell model_ to account for nuclear spin and magnetic
moments, treating nucleons as discrete, independent particles. These descriptions are mutually
inconsistent – the nucleus cannot be both a continuous fluid and a set of independent particles
simultaneously. Yet, both models are highly successful in the corresponding domain of each. This
indicates that scientific success does not require a single, unique underlying truth, blocking the
realists’ path to infer that success reveals an approximation of such truth. Therefore, NMA’s
functionality is challenged by the scientific practice on a metaphysical premise it assumes.

## Constructive Empiricism and the Exclusivity Claim

One more bold, often overlooked claim of NMA – its _exclusivity_ claim, that realism is the
_only_ non-miraculous explanation of success, can be refuted simply via the existence of another
such explanation. Constructive Empiricism (CE), developed by Bas van Fraassen, challenges this
exclusivity claim by offering an alternative account. CE holds that the aim of science is not truth
regarding the unobservable world, but _empirical adequacy_. According to van Fraassen (1980), a
theory is acceptable if it correctly describes targeted _observable_ phenomena and events (p.12).
Scientists need not believe the theory’s unobservable posits even if they use it. Scientific theories
succeed because they are empirically adequate, not because their unobservable claims are
approximately true (as claimed by realists). CE explains novel predictive success by noting that
empirically adequate theories will, by definition, produce successful predictions. One major
objection to this viewpoint is that scientists aim at explanations too, not just prediction and CE
seems to undermine the scientific explanation. However, CE argues that explanations still serve
in a pragmatic role, valuable as a “practical tool” rather than a literal description of unobservable
reality (van Fraassen, 1980, p. 88). Scientists use explanations to organize phenomena, guide and
design experiments – but history shows that explanatory mechanisms are frequently replaced
even when empirical success remains. Another objection is that CE relies on _ambiguous
boundaries_ between observable and unobservable (Musgrave, 1988, p. 244). CE counters this by
asserting that a non-ambiguous distinction can be made by carefully defining the scope of claims
about unobservables (Muller & van Fraassen, 2008). With this in mind, “observable” can refer to
what scientists have reliable access to, not to a rigid metaphysical category. CE requires only this
practice-based distinction and only needs to be viably coherent, not flawless, to refute the NMA’s
exclusivity premise. With CE _available as a coherent alternative_ without a commitment to the
literal truth of unobservables, NMA loses its premise that realism is the _only_ non-miraculous
explanation of success, failing on its own terms.

## Structural Realism and its Limitations

Realists have attempted to rescue their positions, major response being Structural Realism
(SR) stated by Worrall (1989). SR attempts to preserve truth through theory change by claiming
that the retained part of scientific theories is _the structure_ rather than the specific theoretical
entities proposed. While this response addresses historical evidence well enough, SR ultimately
surrenders what the NMA was supposed to defend: commitment to the existence and accurate
description of unobservable entities. If SR restricts realism to the perseverance of mathematical
(or relational) structure, then it does not support NMA’s conclusion that theories are
approximately true in their claims about the _unobservable world_. Instead, it abandons this claim
to form a more abstract realism. SR, therefore, cannot rescue the NMA to its original force.

## Conclusion

The **No Miracles Argument** remains an influential intuition but ultimately **fails to justify
scientific realism**. Its reliance on IBE causes an unreliable form of [circular reasoning in the
unobservable domain](#circular-reasoning-in-the-unobservable-domain).
Its [fundamental commitment](#the-uniqueness-of-truth-assumption-against-scientific-practice) to a picture with a single convergent truth is
destabilized by model pluralism in scientific practice. And [Constructive Empiricism directly
refutes NMA’s exclusivity claim](#constructive-empiricism-and-the-exclusivity-claim) by providing a coherent, non-miraculous alternative account of
scientific success. [Structural Realism does not save the NMA](#structural-realism-and-its-limitations), as it abandons the entity-level
commitments the argument was meant to justify. Scientific success is undeniable, but the realist’s
inference from success to truth by employing NMA remains unwarranted.
