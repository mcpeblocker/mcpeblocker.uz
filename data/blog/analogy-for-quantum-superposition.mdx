Imagine there are two states possible when you apply for internship:

- either you get in (accepted)
- or not (rejected).

Here's the overall process:

- You apply for internship.
- From now on you can be in either one of the states mentioned above until you get the official response via email.
- So, from your perspective you can say, "I'm both accepted and rejected" - placing yourself in indecision and therefore requiring plans for both scenarios (thinking out what to do next after both outcomes). This can be analog for superposition: you're both accepted and rejected at the same time, from your own perspective. That is, until you get the official response.
- Getting response can be analog for quantum measurement. After you get it you know for sure whether you're accepted or not. In quantum terms, your superposition state will collapse into a single definite state giving you what we call a measurement outcome. At this point, you're not in superposition anymore - you're in a definite, single collapsed state.

That's it. Good luck with internships!
